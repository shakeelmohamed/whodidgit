    <h1>Who Did Git?</h1>
    <div>
        Do an HTTP request on this domain with the following parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>owner (the GitHub repository owner or organization)</li>
            <li>repo (the name of the GitHub repository)</li>
            <li>sha (the sha of the individual GitHub commit</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        And we'll give you some JSON from the GitHub API about the author of that commit.
    </div>
    <div>
        Here's an example:
        <br>
        <pre>
            ?owner=splunk&amp;repo=splunk-sdk-java&amp;sha=94894b1c63a2388aed097e96c0253585f474c1ae
        </pre>
        Which would return:
        <br>
        <pre>
            GitHub gave us this information about the author of that commit:
            <br>
            {"name":"Shakeel Mohamed","email":"smohamed@splunk.com","date":"2015-01-29T00:39:01Z"}
        </pre>
    </div>
